;;; Exercise 1.44: 
;;; The idea of smoothing a function is an important concept in signal processing. 
;;; If f is a function and d x is some small number, then the smoothed version of f 
;;; is the function whose value at a point x is the average of f ( x âˆ’ d x ) , f ( x ) , and f ( x + d x ) . 
;;; Write a procedure smooth that takes as input a procedure that computes f and returns a procedure that computes the smoothed f . 
;;; It is sometimes valuable to repeatedly smooth a function (that is, smooth the smoothed function, and so on) to obtain the n-fold smoothed function. 
;;; Show how to generate the n-fold smoothed function of any given function using smooth and repeated from Exercise 1.43.
